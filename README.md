## 1 Task

This project is to implement neural network and convolutional neural network for the task of classifi-
cation.

The classification task will be that of recognizing an image and identify it as one of ten classes.

You are required to train the classifiers using Fashion-MNIST clothing images. Following are the three
tasks to be performed:

1. Build a Neural Network with one hidden layer to be trained and tested on Fashion-MNIST
dataset. Code from scratch in Python.

2. Build multi-layer Neural Network with open-source neural-network library, Keras on Fashion-
MNIST dataset.

3. Build Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with open-source neural-network library, Keras on
Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Evaluate the results obtained by each of the classifier (Single layer Neural Network, Multi-Layer
neural network and CNN) as shown in the evaluation section.



## 2 Dataset

For training and testing of our classifiers, we will use the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Fashion-MNIST
is a dataset of Zalandoâ€™s article images, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set
of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each
pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel,
with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and
represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated
image.



## 3 Plan of Work

1. Extract feature values and labels from the data: Fashion MNIST dataset is downloaded
and processed into a Numpy array that contains the feature vectors and a Numpy array that
contains the labels using fashion mnist reader notebook present inside the scripts folder.

2. Data Partitioning: The Fashion MNIST dataset is originally partitioned into a training set
and a testing set. You will use this partition and train your model on the training set.
3. Train using Neural Network with One Hidden Layer Use Gradient Descent for neural
network to train the model using a group of hyperparameters. (Code from scratch in python)

4. Train using Multi-Layer Neural Network with high level Neural Network library, Keras
using a group of hyperparameters.

5. Train using Convolution Neural Network with high level Neural Network library, Keras
using a group of hyperparameters.

6. Tune hyper-parameters: For steps 3, 4 and 5: Validate the classfication performance of your
model on the validation set. Change your hyper-parameters and repeat the step. Try to find
what values those hyperparameters should take so as to give better performance on the testing
set.

7. Test your machine learning scheme on the testing set: For steps 3, 4 and 5: After
tuning the hyper-parameters, fix your hyper-parameters and model parameter and test your
models performance on the testing set. This shows the ultimate effectiveness of your models
generalization power gained by learning.
